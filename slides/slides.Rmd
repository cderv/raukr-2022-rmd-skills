Everyone should know rmarkdown among R users. Its principle has not changed since a long time 
(md + R = Rmd -> output format) quite easy to start (write text, add code chunk, compile) but it can be harder to learn new skill to be more efficient and get full power. 

That is where known recipes can help master more advanced skills. R Markdown Cookbook was thought as a non linear documentation.

Also new logo and new pkgdown website

We often see these rmarkdown little wizard mixing Text & Code to produce document. Aim is to look deeper into this today. This is not so magic. It is juts percieved magic and there are tools to know about under the hood to be able to customize behavior further.

rmarkdown will run Pandoc & knitr for you.

LaTeX only needed with PDF. tinytex will run it for you.  

This is important to know all this because it helps know where to look and what could be tweak. one has to understand what to tweak to make something works as expected.

# About the tools

.subtitle[We got you covered!]

* **rmarkdown** `r emo::ji("package")` will install **knitr** and **tinytex** for you
* _Pandoc_ is an external binary tool, .color1.underline[included] inside RStudio IDE. 
* _TinyTeX_ is the only thing to install if you want PDF output. (`tinytex::install_tinytex()`)

.pull-left[

In case you need it:
(.small[but you probably won't!])

* [Use another Pandoc version](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-pandoc.html) (should never be necessary!)
* [Install missing LaTeX package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex-pkgs.html) (should not be necessary as **tinytex** will do it for you at render)

Best to use TinyTeX as it is tested agains rmarkdown. 

Everything should work as expected otherwise. No special tool needed unless for advanced usage. 

Missing CTAN packages are installed by tinytex the R package.

First thing to focus one: Boost the content of the R Markdown.

# Writing long chunk options

`r new_ribbon()`

.subtitle[About the chunk header syntax `#|`]

Using R syntax (`tag = value`, comma-separated, arbitrary wrapping)

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r}
#| echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10,
#| fig.cap = "This is a long caption."

plot(cars)
```
````

Using YAML syntax (`tag: value`; one option per line)

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig.width: 10
#| fig.cap: "This is a long caption."

plot(cars)

# Read external scripts into a chunk

`r new_ribbon()`

.subtitle[About the `file` chunk option]


.panelset[

```{cat, engine.opts = list(file = "my_script.R", lang = "r")}
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y

```{r, include = FALSE}

* Can be used with multiple script (e.g `file = c("foo.R", "bar.R")`)

From Bookdown : https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/option-code.html

Useful for bigger project, or when script already exists.

# Chunk content from variable

.subtitle[About the `code` chunk option]

Ex: Installation instruction for packages. 

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r, include = FALSE}
pkgs <- c("glue", "fs")
installation_package <- sprintf('install.packages("%s")', pkgs)
```
*```{r, eval = FALSE, code = installation_package}
```
````

renders without evaluating to 
```{r, eval=FALSE, code = {pkgs <- c("glue", "fs");sprintf('install.packages("%s")', pkgs)}}
```

???

This is just an example and this can be done with any chunk option. It is quite powerful !

# Read code chunks from a script

.subtitle[About `knitr::read_chunk()`]

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[my_script.R]

Use a special comment syntax to label code content.

```r
## ---- chunk-label
```
Ex in `my_chunks.R`

````r
## ---- my-chunk-a --------
1 + 1

## ---- my-chunk-b --------
plot(cars)
```` 
]

.panel[.panel-name[report.Rmd]

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
Read an external script to load chunks:

```{r, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
*knitr::read_chunk('my_script.R')
```

Now the code can be used chunk by chunk, e.g.,

```{r, my-chunk-a, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r, my-chunk-b, fig.height=4}
```
````

]

]

???

Useful for:

* sharing common part of code in a script
* Store all R code in one R file
* For bigger project often, or when script already exists.

# Use Rmd child document

.subtitle[About `child` chunk option]

Load same content in several Rmd document

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r common-setup, include = FALSE, child = "_common.Rmd"}
```
````

Conditionally include a content

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
Change `BOSS_MODE` to `TRUE` if this report is to be read
by the boss:

```{r, include=FALSE}
# variable impacting the rendering, which could be a parameter of a report
*BOSS_MODE <- FALSE
```

Conditionally include the appendix:

*```{r, child=if (!BOSS_MODE) 'appendix.Rmd'}
```
````

???

This respect chunk option so could be useful for conditionnally eval or not a part of a document. 

Also useful to organize project in smaller pieces.

Quite like child document but a bit different. Can be useful sometimes for programatically create markdown content.

# Reuse a chunk

.subtitle[About chunk `label`]

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
Here is a code chunk that is not evaluated:

*```{r, chunk-one, eval = FALSE}
1 + 1
2 + 2
```

Now we actually evaluate it:

*```{r, chunk-one, eval = TRUE}
```
````

First chunk will be used twice - different options are allowed.

Reuse a figure, Show code in another place that the initial result, show figure in another place than where the plot has been evaluated. Recompute the same content.

Yes chunk content can be combined. Could be useful to show code in appendix at the end of the document for example.

# Use CSS from inside a Rmd file

  padding: 0.5em;

/* Set to blue bold text inside the box */
div.mybox strong {

Applied directly in the Rmd document without an external css file 

Going further: See the [`js` engine](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/details-tag.html) to apply JS code the same way

Useful for prototyping, for quick iteration, for single file example
echo = false is important if you don't want to show CSS source chunk in output

# Use SASS the same way

.subtitle[About the `sass`/`scss` engine]

---

### What is SASS ?

Sass (https://sass-lang.com) is a CSS extension language that allows you to create CSS rules in much more flexible ways than you would do with plain CSS.
</br>
</br>
.center[![:scale 25%](https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg)]

It allows for variables, tweaking functions (called _mixins_), operations (like `/`), better CSS rule organisation (nesting, extensions, ...) and more.

???

External tool used by web developers. Very powerful and this is a skill to learn when doing a lot of HTML. It can do a lot ! 

But no need to use it directly. Still need to learn the feature and syntax.

External `.sass` / `.scss` file can also be passed in the `css` argument of `html_document()`

````yaml

Extend the Pandoc feature for LaTeX environment. Not done by default in Pandoc. 
Special feature of rmarkdown.

Using the `cat` engine can help you write the preamble from within the Rmd file

````markdown
`r ''````{cat, engine.opts = list(file = 'preamble.tex')}
\usepackage{tcolorbox}
\newtcolorbox{mybox}{
  colframe=blue,
  halign=center,
  boxsep=5pt,
  arc=4pt}
```
````

This will result in the PDF as this box

```{r, include = FALSE}
if (!tinytex::check_installed("standalone")) tinytex::tlmgr_install("standalone")
```

```{texpreview, box-preview, code = c(xfun::read_utf8(tmp_tex), content), echo = FALSE}
```

???

Just for showing cat engine usage here; 

And try texPreview in source file
